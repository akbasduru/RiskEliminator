# Risk Eliminator


Risk Eliminator is an AI-driven decision-support system designed to assist venture capital firms in evaluating startup investments under uncertainty. The project integrates economic theory with machine learning to analyze pitch materials, founder signals, market conditions, and historical investment outcomes.

Rather than predicting success solely from surface-level pitch quality, Risk Eliminator focuses on latent risk factors, strategic pivots, and post-investment adaptability, capturing cases where startups initially appear weak but later outperform expectations.
